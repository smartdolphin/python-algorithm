# Algorithms and Data Structures implemented in Python
Here are code snippets about algorithms, data structures, problems. These codes are written for practice and need to be optimised.

## Data struct
- stack
- queue
- linked list
- hash table
- graph

## Algorithm
- recursive binary search
- iterative binary search
- depth first search
- breadth first search
- parametric search
- quick sort
- counting sort

## Problem
- reverse integer ([leetcode #7](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer))
- factorial
